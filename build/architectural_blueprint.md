# Architectural Blueprint for Quote of the Day Service

## Overview
This document outlines the architectural design for the "Quote of the Day" web service. The service is built using FastAPI and utilizes Supabase as a backend for managing quotes.

## SQL Schema for Quotes Table
The `quotes` table will be created in the Supabase database with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quotes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

### Table Description
- **id**: A unique identifier for each quote (auto-incremented).
- **text**: The text body of the quote.
- **author**: The name of the author who originated the quote.

## API Endpoint
The API will expose a single endpoint as follows:
- **GET /api/quote**: Returns a random quote in JSON format from the `quotes` table.

### JSON Response Format
The response will adhere to the following structure:
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "text": "Your quote here.",
    "author": "Author Name"
}
```

## Non-Functional Considerations
- **Performance**: The API is designed to respond within 200 ms.
- **Scalability**: The initial architecture supports up to 10,000 requests per hour.
- **Security**: Basic authentication will be implemented to secure the API.
