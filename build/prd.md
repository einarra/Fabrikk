# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
The project is to create a web service called "Quote of the Day" using FastAPI. The service will provide users with a random quote each day by retrieving data from a Supabase database.

## Objectives
1. Build a RESTful API endpoint `/api/quote`.
2. Use Supabase for storing and managing quotes.
3. Ensure the API returns a random quote in JSON format.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- **Database Requirements:**
  - Use Supabase as a backend resource.
  - Create a `quotes` table with the following columns:
    - `id`: Primary key, unique identifier for each quote.
    - `text`: Text of the quote.
    - `author`: Name of the author of the quote.

- **API Requirements:**
  - Create a single API endpoint: `/api/quote`.
  - When a GET request is made to the endpoint, the API should:
    - Connect to the Supabase database.
    - Retrieve one random quote from the `quotes` table.
    - Return the quote in JSON format with the structure:
      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "Your quote here.",
        "author": "Author Name"
      }
      ```

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The API should respond within 200 ms for each request.
- **Scalability:** The service should accommodate up to 10,000 requests per hour in its initial phase.
- **Security:** The API should have basic authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** Supabase
- **Hosting:** Could be on any cloud platform such as AWS, DigitalOcean, or Vercel.

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up Supabase Account
2. Create `quotes` table with required schema.
3. Initialize FastAPI application.
4. Implement `/api/quote` endpoint.
5. Write logic to retrieve a random quote from Supabase.
6. Set up authentication for API.
7. Deploy the application.
8. Monitor performance and iterate as necessary.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional API endpoint.
- Documentation detailing the API usage.
- Deployment of the web service.

## Timeline
- Estimated completion time: 4 weeks.
- Weekly progress updates will be provided.
